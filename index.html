          <h2>Why Nature Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Nature, in its vast and dynamic splendor, envelops the essence of our planet's life force. It's a tapestry woven with the threads of biodiversity, ecosystems, and the interdependent relationships that sustain life. As we delve into the significance of nature, we uncover the myriad ways it supports, inspires, and challenges humanity.

      <button class="accordion">Cape Breton Highlands</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Atlantic Canada's oldest national park features Acadian and boreal forest environments in the Cape Breton Highlands. One-third of the Cabot Trail passes through the central portion of the park. Most of Nova Scotia's population of Canada lynx are found in this park, and the endangered North Atlantic right whale is found in waters off the park's coast. Western moose were introduced to this park from Alberta's Elk Island National Park between 1947 and 1948, the native eastern moose having been hunted to near-extinction.[17][18] Parks Canada started a four-year project with the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources and other partners to begin to restore boreal forest regions within this park in 2014.

Eighteen moose (nine males and nine females) from Elk Island were introduced to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1948.
